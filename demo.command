When watching a TV show or movie, have you ever spotted a familiar face but
can't remember the actor's name or what other shows you've seen them in?

To solve this I used to go to the IMDb website; find the show; click on "See
full cast & crew"; find the character; click on the actor's name; then scroll
through their "Filmography" to see if I recognized any other shows I'd watched.
This was both time-consuming and difficult -- even more so if I wanted to know
if two shows had actors in common.

I wrote IMDb_xref to answer such questions simply and quickly. Now I have
even more fun learning about actors and shows.

The following screens will first pose a question about the PBS show "The Crown"
then pause. Hitting any key will find the answer, then pause again.

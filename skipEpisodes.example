# This is a manually managed tab separated file of IMDb tconst IDs to exclude from processing.

# When a tvSeries is processed, all its tvEpisodes are automatically looked up, processed, and added.
# If a tvSeries has hundreds of tvEpisodes or its cast/crew aren't relevant, add the tvSeries tconst
# below and its tvEpisodes will not be processed.

# Only the tconst field is used. Additional fields are not needed, but useful for documentation.

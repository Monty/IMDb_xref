# This is a sample tab separated file of IMDb tconst IDs to exclude from processing.

# When a tvSeries is processed, all its tvEpisodes are automatically looked up,
# processed, and added. If a tvSeries has hundreds of tvEpisodes or its
# cast & crew aren't relevant, add the tvSeries tconst below and its tvEpisodes
# will not be processed.

# Create a similar skipEpisodes file of shows to exclude episodes from processing.
# If it has a .skipEpisodes extension, it will be automatically processed.
# However it can have any name and extension and be passed as a parameter
# on the command line using the -s switch, e.g. -s Netflix.skipEpisodes.txt

# Only the tconst field is used. Additional fields are not needed, but useful
# for documentation.

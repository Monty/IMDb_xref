# This is a manually managed tab separated file of IMDb tconst IDs to exclude
# from processing.

# When a tvSeries is processed, all its tvEpisodes are automatically looked up,
# processed, and added. If a tvSeries has hundreds of tvEpisodes or its
# cast & crew aren't relevant, add the tvSeries tconst below and its tvEpisodes
# will not be processed.

# Only the tconst field is used. Additional fields are not needed, but useful
# for documentation.
